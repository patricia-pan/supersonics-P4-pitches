*Format for pitch markdown:*
* Name of app - Trixia Painting
* Your name/team members - Patricia Pan
* New tech you plan on using - Shopify and Material UI (frontend framework)

Answer: 
1. How do you plan on learning/implementing this new technology? - Documentation, Medium articles, Youtube videos.
2. What is your goal with this project? - Create a website that can take secure payments. List items for sale. Convert my paint 'n sip workshops into a side hustle. 
3. Who is the user for your app? - Anyone who is interested in hosting a mobile paint 'n sip event, such as for corporate events, team building events, kids' birthday parties, bachelorette parties. 
4. Any potential roadblocks you think you might run into? - I might have trouble with the more complex parts of setting up Stripe or Material UI, where it might not have been documnted. I learn best from example and seeing actual code, and sometimes the documentation doesn't include sample code that's complex enough for my needs.
